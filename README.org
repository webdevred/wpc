* Introduction

WPC (Wallpaper Changer) is a program that allows the user to set wallpapers for both the desktop and lock screen. It is a simple and easy-to-use application that lets you personalize your computer and make it more visually appealing.

The program supports various image formats and makes it easy to change the wallpaper with a user-friendly interface.

* Features

[[file:wpc_demo.gif]]

- Set wallpapers for both the *desktop* and *lock screen*.
- Store background source directory along with set backgrounds for monitors in a *config file*.
- Ability to *change the source directory* directly from the GUI.
- No need for `sudo` (previously required for manually editing `/etc/lightdm/*`).
- Clean separation between *desktop wallpaper* handling and *lock screen wallpaper* handling.
- Support for common image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.).
- [[file:BG_MODES.org][Multiple wallpaper modes]]

* Planned features/todo list

- Add Wayland support
- Migrate from JSON to toml for config
- Improve security for desktop manager helper
- Implement support for other desktop manager than LightDM + lightdm-gtk-greeter
- Implement caching of thumbnails for wallpapers in the UI
- Add -d flag which should behave like -b flag (which starts with no GUI and sets backgrounds and exits) but keep the software running and switch backgrounds according to algo on a configurable interval

* Installation

To install WPC, follow these steps:
#+begin_src bash
     git clone https://github.com/webdevred/wpc
     cd wpc
     gcc nob.c -o nob
     ./nob
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can use the legacy Makefile:  
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/webdevred/wpc
  cd wpc
  make
#+end_src

Both build systems should work, but nob is the preferred method.

* Usage

You can create this config file in ~/.config/wpc/settings.json before you start the program.
If you do not create a config file then source directory will be set to your pictures directory in your home directory.

#+begin_src js
  {
      "sourceDirectoryPath" : "/mnt/HDD/backgrounds/",
      "monitorsWithBackgrounds": []
  }
#+end_src
